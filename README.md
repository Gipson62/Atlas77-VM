# Reg-lang

Experimental language build with rust.

Its aim is :

    [] To be simple to help learning programmation with, and in a second hand, to be robust enough to power complex software.
    [] Both interpreted and compiled.
    [] Dymanic and statically typed (You can choose the one you want)
    [] Live programming
    [] To provide a new type of asynchronous operations
    [] New type of Debugger, more simpler for the programmer
    [] Error handler like Lisp
    [] Lot of librairies to help building complex software
