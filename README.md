# Reg-lang

Experimental language build with Rust.

Its aim is :

- [ ] To be simple to help learning programmation with, and in a second hand, to be robust enough to power complex software.
> Maybe ? (lmao yes obviously)

- [ ] Both interpreted and compiled.
> The interpreter is nearly ready to go!

- [ ] Dymanicaly and statically typed (You can choose the one you want).
> Need to check again if we keep that or not
> There gonna be a `Any` Type, so the Dynamic typing can be used with that

- [ ] Live programming.
> A prototype for that is being written... just need to w8 a bit.

- [ ] To provide a new type of asynchronous operations.
> No real idea for now...

- [ ] New type of Debugger, more simpler for the programmer.
> Ideas but nothing more...

- [ ] Lot of librairies to help building complex software such as a Math, Science, Game Engine ones for example.
> The prototype is nearly finished... just need to w8 a bit.
